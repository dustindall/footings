# Footings - A Model Building Library

![CI](https://github.com/dustindall/footings-core/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


## What is it?
Footings is a model building Python library. No out-of-the box models are provided. Instead it is a framework library that provides key objects and functions to help users  construct custom models.

## Purpose
The footings library was developed with the intention of making it easier to develop actuarial models in Python. Actuarial models tend to be a mix of data engineering and math/calculations. In addition, actuarial models are ususally not defined by one calculation, but a series of calculations. So even though the original purpose is actuarial work, if the problem at hand sounds familiar, others might find this library useful.

## Principles
Below are the guiding priniples of the footings framework -

- Leverage the amazing Python ecosystem.
- Models are a series of steps, keep the steps distinct from each other and drawdependencies where needed.
- Models can be combined to form other models.
- Models need validation throughout.
- Models should be easy to understand and audit.
- Models should be self documenting.
